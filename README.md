# CantrEnhanced
A pure-JS greasemonkey script containing a set of useful tools and UI improvements for the Cantr game

# Origin
I've created it mostly in 2011-2012. It's my first serious project in JavaScript and one of the first big programs in general.

The reason why it was created were the longstanding issues with the interface of Cantr - a browser-based role-playing game and, as such things were unmaintained,
there was no hope that they will be fixed in the foreseeable future.

I've started with a simple script that has shown some additional info to make it easier to store items in containers, then added things like events filtering, list of people who were recently talked to, resources calculator, grouping similar events and many other tiny UI improvements. Many of these changes were later incorporated into the game after I became a Cantr developer. Since then, most of the changes were considered just an intermediate step before enabling them for everyone and my main focus was to correctly disable script's options and ensure its compatibility after the game changes.

The code is written in pure JavaScript, because I didn't know JQuery right then and there's no reason to rewrite it now.

The script was posted on userscripts.org, but after it's death it is rehosted [on greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/7409-cantr-enhanced).
